# crafting code training
Repository contains examples created during the course. The training is designed to help developers to write code that is
 well-crafted and follows the SOLID principles by applying Test Driven Development (TDD).
 
**1. Example**
Create a stack with TDD. Focus on naming conventions. Start with writing a test. 
Use inside out technique - test against expected state.

**2. Example**
Create an arabic to roman numeral converter. Focus on evolving the solution in the smallest steps possible. 
No over engineering. Validate every steps with a test.

**3. Example**
Calculate a leap year. Create tests in a way so they express what business logic will be tested. 

**4. Example**
Create payment service that orchestrates and delegates to other services. Use mocking to test behaviour - not state.

**5. Example**
Create simplified accounting logic with outside in TDD fashion(London School). Start with the high level acceptance 
test and evolve the solution down to the unit level.
